                Why are there so many names for the JavaScript language?
                There's JavaScript, Live Script, Mocha, JScript, and
                ECMAScript. Why? This came to us thanks in good part
                to the project of its early development. That included
                a joint venture under the supervision of Sun Microsystems
                (the developer of Java) and old Netscape browser. Its original
                development name was Mocha. It had nothing to do with Java.
                In fact, the designer ignored the instructions to design it
                based on Java. Don't be confused about that. When it was released,
                by Netscape and presented in its browser, it was called
                Live Script. Then as a joke it was renamed JavaScript.
                Not a single part of Java was used other than in the name.
            </p>
            <p>
                Microsoft saw how good Netscape was and began a series
                of attacks against them. They reverse engineered the JavaScript
                language, renamed it JScript, and incorporated it into their
                Internet Explorer browser, which they bundled with their
                operating system to try to destroy Netscape.

                Every major browser vendor then re-named the
                language, so it got a bunch of different names.
                This resulted in a mess, because the whole idea of it
                was to be able to create a program once and be able to
                distribute it everywhere. That's what cross-platform was
                supposed to be.

                Standards were eventually incorporated between
                all the browser vendors, and that's where the European Computer
                Manufacturers' Association Standards came into effect
                (and hence ECMAScript). Visit the ECMA websidt to
                read whitepapers on how JavaScript is supposed to
                work with the uniform standards.
                https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/9.0/index.html#sec-terms-and-definitions
            </p>
            <p>
                A very important thing you'll hear about JavaScript (or Mocha,
                or Live Script, or JScript, or ECMAScript) is that it is
                an object-oriented language (which, by the way, Java is not).
                Java and JavaScript are nothing alike. They have completely
                different syntax (the way the two languages are written), and
                they function completely differently.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your browser has different programs associated with it.
                Three key programs functioning in your browsers for JavaScript
                are: 1) the DOM parser. It takes computer HTML code and turns
                it into human readable format that is visually understandable.
                It also contains 2) a CSS parser. That renders the document
                layout. They're actually combined in one rendering agent. The
                JavaScript rendering engine has different names in different
                browsers (Firefox:spidermonkey; Google:the V-8 engine;
                Safari:Night Pro; Internet Explorer:Chikara).
            </p>
            <p>
                It converts the human readable format into machine code.
                It does that processing on the client computer (that's why
                it's called 'client side'). With JavaScript this is done
                in an interpreter called a JIT Compiler ('just in time') meaning
                that it takes the human readable instructions, converts them
                to machine code, and executes them quickly at that specific
                moment and returns the output back in human readable form.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript has its own console. You can type javascript
                commands into the javascript engine console, and it will
                take those commands live to the JIT engine and return the
                returned output in human readable form. Any errors and warnings
                will also appear in the console window. In Google, right clik
                on any page and select inspect. That opens the Developer Tools.
                There will be a tab marked Console that will open the console
                window. In Firefox: right-click 'Inspect Element'; Safari: open
                Preferences, enable Developern Tools; then right-click anywhere
                on page and select 'Inspect Element'; Internet Explorer: press F12.

                If you don't understand Objects, you won't understand any
                programming language, no matter what it is. So, it
                is critical that you understand the concept.
                At its simplest basic level, your program only contains nouns,
                adjectives, and verbs.

                Nouns and adjectives describe. In the live world around you, objects
                have properties, and those properties are nouns:
                an apple has properties. The object 'apple' has noun
                properties that describe it, key and value pairs such as
                width, heigth, weight, and color are properties that describe
                the object apple. The noun color (with its adjective 'red'
                combined describe the object more completely.

                Verbs are actions that perform an action, which is a function.
                for example an apple could have these properties:
                <code>
                    {
                        width: 25,
                        length: 27,
                        color: "red",
                        weight: 5,
                        eat: function(){"Eat the apple.";},
                        throw: function(){"Throw the apple away.";}
                    }
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                When a function is contained within an object, as they are above,
                they're called a "Methods." Its that simple. Objects encapsulated
                (joined together) within the squigly brackets, allow you to group
                information together that relates to certain aspects of your
                program.
            </p>
            <p>
                Think of every object you come into contact with in your
                world as something within those squigly brackets. Just as
                in everyday life, objects can contain other objects { {} }.
                Object within objects describe a heirarchy of objects.

                Every program has an API (application programming interface).
                It is a collection of functions and properties. Take a look at
                the window object in the console window. It has many functions
                and properties already written into it. If you install
                a library such as jQuery, you're adding an "embedded," "extension,"
                or "extended" API. That's what libraries are. They use the native
                JavaScript API to add functions onto its style.

                Any object you create with your own methods and functions itself
                goes into the pre-defined window object, and you're essentially
                creating your own API. Each web page has its own window object.

                The basic data types in JavaScript are:
                <li>
                    strings - they are defined by double quote or single quote
                    you can escape quotes also
                    for example, in the string "he said "hello""
                    you have two strings - one is "he said "
                    and the othre is ""
                    with the word hello being JavaScript
                    If you type that string into the Console Tab, you'll get
                    a syntax error
                    you escape by putting a reverse slash immediately in front
                    of the quote you want to negate
                    "he said \"hello\"" will return "he said "hello" "
                    You could also mix and match using both double and
                    single quotes
                    as in "he said 'hello'"
                </li>
                <li>
                    numbers - there are two number types: integers
                    and floating point
                    100
                    200
                    1
                    are whole number integers

            To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Developer Tools
            in your browser: for Google, Ctrl-Shift-I, Firefox, Scratchpad
            to write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
            Select the Console Tab, and type the following code --
            <!--
                The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).

            <p>
                Programs need to store values and call them up later
                out of memory when needed.

                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                identifiers, conform to
                certain rules.

                To create a variable you use the var keyword
                Think of this as creating a box
                <code>
                    var name = "Ray";
                </code>
                The word name is not a string. It is a symbol like an
                address
                The equal sign is a command to the JIT compiler - an
                assignment operator
                It takes what is to the right of the equal sign and
                assigns it to the box called name
                You end lines of code in JavaScript with a semicolon
                The assigned value could be a number, or a string, or
                a Boolean, null, undefined, an object, or an array

                You can create a variable without assigning a value
                to it. It's just an empty box waiting for you to put
                something in it.

                You can also change the variable type, making it
                a string, number, Boolean, an object {} or an array [].

            <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                characters can also be digits
                (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase)
                and the
                characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).

            <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode
                escape sequences as
                characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

            You can declare a variable in three ways:
            <!--
                The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
            -->
            <p>
                With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax can be used to declare both
                local
                and global variables.
            </p>
            <!--

            -->
            <p>
                By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global
                variable.
                It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.

            <p>
                With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax can be used to declare a block

                local variable. See Variable scope below.

            <p>
                When you declare a variable outside of any function,
                it is called a global variable, because it is available
                to any other code in the current document. When you declare
                a variable within a function, it is called a local
                variable, because it is available only within that
                function.

            -->
            <p>
                JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block
                statement scope; rather, a variable declared within
                a block is local to the function (or global scope) that
                the block resides within. For example the following
                code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function
                (or global context) within which x is declared, not
                the block, which in this case is an if statement.
            </p>
            <!--
                The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
            -->
            <code>
                if (true) {
                    var x = 5;
                }

            <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object.

                Consequently, you can access global variables declared 
                in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying 
                the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called 
                phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this 
                variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.

            <p>
                You can create a read-only, named constant with 
                the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier
                is the same as for a variable identifier: it must 
                start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and 
                can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore 
                characters.

            <p>
                A constant cannot change value through assignment or 
                be re-declared while the script is running. It has
                to be initialized to a value.

                You can't assing a value later on. The value has to
                be assigned right away when you create the constant.

                The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword
                is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent 
                a variable.

            Although these data types are a relatively small amount, 
            they enable you to perform useful functions with
            your applications. Objects and functions are the other 
            fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects 
            as named containers for values, and functions as procedures 
            that your application can perform.

            Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical 
            condition is true. Use the optional else clause to
            execute a statement if the condition is false. 
            An if statement looks as follows:
            <!--
                The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
            -->
            <code>
                if (condition) {
                    statement_1;
                } else {
                    statement_2;
                }
            </code> condition can be any expression that evaluates 
            to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation
            of what evaluates to true and false. If condition 
            evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
            statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 
            can be any statement, including further nested if 
            statements.
            <!--
                The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
            -->
            <p>
                You may also compound the statements using else if 
                to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as
                follows:
            </p>
            <!--
                The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
            -->
            <code>
                if (condition_1) {
                    statement_1;
                } else if (condition_2) {
                    statement_2;
                } else if (condition_n) {
                    statement_n;
                } else {
                    statement_last;
                } 
            </code> 
            In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical 
            condition which evaluates to true will be executed. 
            To execute multiple statements, group them within a block 
            statement ({ ... }). In general, it's good practice to 
            always use block statements, especially when nesting if 
            statements:
            <!--
                The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
            -->
            <code>
                if (condition) {
                    statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                    statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                } else {
                    statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                    statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                }
            </code>
            It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a 
            conditional expression, because the assignment
            can be confused with equality when glancing over the 
            code. For example, do not use the following code:
            <!--
                The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
            -->
            <code>
                if (x = y) {
                    /* statements here */
                }
            </code>
            If you need to use an assignment in a conditional 
            expression, a common practice is to put additional
            parentheses around the assignment. For example:
            <!--
                The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
            -->
            <code>
                if ((x = y)) {
                    /* statements here */
                }
            </code>

        <article>
            A while statement executes its statements as long as 
            a specified condition evaluates to true. A while
            statement looks as follows:
            <!--
                The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
            -->
            <code>
                while (condition)
                    statement
            </code>
                If the condition becomes false, statement within 
                the loop stops executing and control passes to 
                the statement following the loop.
            <!--
                The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
            -->
            <p>
                The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true,
                statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
                control is passed to the statement following while.
            </p>
            <!--
                The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
            -->
            <p>
                To execute multiple statements, use a block statement 
                ({ ... }) to group those statements.
            </p>

            Example:
            <!--
                The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
            -->
            <p>
                The following while loop iterates as long as n is less 
                than three:
            </p>
            <!--
                The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
            -->
            <code>
                var n = 0;
                var x = 0;
                while (n < 3) {                 
                n++;
                x += n;
                }               
            </code>
            <!--

            -->
            <p>
                With each iteration, the loop increments n and 
                adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on 
                the following values:
            </p>

            A function definition (also called a function declaration,

            followed by:
            <!--

                For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
            </p>
            <!--
                The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
            -->
            <code>
                function square(number) {
                    return number * number;
                }
            </code>
            <!--
                The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
            -->
            <p>
                The function square takes one argument, called 
                number. The function consists of one statement 
                that says to return the argument of the function 
                (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return 
                statement specifies the value returned by the function.
            </p>

            <p>
                Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to 
                functions by value; the value is passed to the function,
                but if the function changes the value of the parameter, 
                this change is not reflected globally or in the calling
                function.
